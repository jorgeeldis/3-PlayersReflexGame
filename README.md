# 3-PlayersReflexGame

> A simple reflex game for 3 people created with an arduino!

This 3 Players Reflex Game was created by the help of two college friends, this was our final project and we decided to create it the best way possible, this game starts by welcoming you to the game where you will see a menu, which you can select the option you want, to read instruction or to play the game, when you play the game theres gonna be a LED thas gonna blink one time between 1-10 sec, when the LED stops that blink, the player has to push the button, the fastest of the three will get the point!
